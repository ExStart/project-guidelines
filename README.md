# project-guidelines

**Work in progress.** Guidelines and best practices for open source projects.

## Goals

 - Collect and organise information on how to run an open source project.
 - Advise and support project maintainers in managing their communities.

## What to expect

Obviously, there is quite a lot to managing an open source project, and not much
in this repository yet. This is a list of contents that will almost certainly be
addressed in this repository:

 - Code review
 - Continuous integration
 - Infrastructure
 - CHANGELOGS
 - CONTRIBUTING guides
 - Codes of conduct
 - Issue handling and triage
 - Setting project goals
 - Finding contributors
 - Promoting the project

If you think you're in great shape to write about one of these topics, or simply
have an idea, then don't hesitate to create an issue or PR.
