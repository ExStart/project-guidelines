# Code of Conduct

We want everyone to have a great time. These rules are meant to make sure that
we can. They describe the tone you can expect in the codebases, issue trackers,
chatrooms, mailing lists, and other online places dedicated to this project.

 1. Be excellent to each other.
 2. We will not tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of gender,
    race, sexual orientation, appearance, language, tabs vs spaces Emacs vs
    Vim, database of choice or anything else for that matter.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, including maintainers, we will take
appropriate action, up to and including, but not limited to, warning the
offender, deletion of comments, removal from the project's codebase and
communication systems and escalation to GitHub support.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of the core team.

Other, additional, rules may apply at events or meetups organised by or
dedicated to this project.

Finally, we all make mistakes. We do give second chances, note that someone
improving after being warned does not warrant you to any retribution. Public
shaming of individuals who have overstepped the rules in this document is
absolutely out of the question.
